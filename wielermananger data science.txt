Similarity between races:

	compare results of top 25 using RBO, averaged over multiple years -> similarity between 0 and 1 between every race.

Time between results:
    	Holt–Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing):further incorporates seasonality components alongside level and trend smoothing.

Results of other races * similarity between races * time between results -> score for that race for that rider


compare with competitor scores and teammates scores to make up a ranking:
	- Teammates can help control the race, chase attacks, lead out, etc.
	Approach:
	    Compute average or weighted average score of team riders (excluding the target).
	    Apply a team support factor, e.g.:
	Option B: Relative Percentile
    		Compute percentile of rider among competitors based on predicted scores.
    		Normalize to a scale (e.g. 0–1) and use that as the final score.
